# 20× Product Roadmap — 9Th-Grade AI

## Phase 0 — Critical fixes

- [x] `DELETE notifications/[id]` → `deleteUserNotification(userId, id)` (P-S1).
- [x] `POST ai/vocab` quota guard (P-S2).
- [x] Unify dual exam-submit validators on strict (P-B1).
- [x] Delete legacy `submitCustomExam` after unrouted proof (P-B2).
- [x] Leaderboard streak cache read (P-F1).
- [ ] Dhaka-tz `studiedToday` (P-C2) — needs timezone-coherent SQL rework, not a one-line patch.
- [x] Remove dead route block (P-C3).

## Phase 1 — UX foundation

- [x] Unbroken rec intents (O2, P-U1) — quiz/resume intents carried.
- [x] Post-result mistake loop (O3, P-U2).
- [x] New-user diagnostic mission (O1, P-U5).
- [x] Difficulty picker in quick practice (O5, P-U3).
- [x] Revision-due strip on Home (O4).
- [x] Dialog-trap adoption (Practice/Custom confirms, NotificationCenter) + 44px targets
  (steppers, modal closes, segmented controls).
- Tokenize marketing/command surfaces (P-D3); timer regime labels (P-U4).
- Tab consolidation design (IA1): Practice hub + Past papers + Exams.

## Phase 2 — Intelligence foundation

- [x] Rec funnel events (REC_ACCEPTED + REC_COMPLETED via POST /api/learning-events;
  accepted on rec/mission tap, completed on rec-started quick-practice submit with outcome)
  (P-N1) — prerequisite for all learning.
- Readiness drivers v1 (deterministic; O8 without LLM).
- Revision-due strip (O4); ContinueLearning resume coverage (B4).
- Difficulty picker + accuracy-by-level (O5, P-U3).
- Weakness heatmap from existing mastery (O9).

## Phase 3 — AI transformation

- [x] "Why wrong" with episodic context (AI3 fix) — explain prompt carries the learner's
  real per-topic history; repeat struggles flagged for misconception-level teaching.
- [x] Agent cancel + executable blocks (P-A2) — verified already present (ComposerBar Stop →
  abort; block dispatcher → drill overlay/tab nav). No code needed.
- [x] Mistake-to-drill generation → implemented as weakness-built AI mocks (O7): `topics`
  focus in mock-test gen + "দুর্বল টপিক থেকে বানাও" in AIMockTestTab.
- [x] Readiness drivers (O8): accuracy/mock/coverage/consistency/trend + biggest lever.
- [ ] O6 AI Study Brief — RESOLVED WITHOUT NEW SURFACE: `ai/opening` already delivers the
  deterministic brief (greeting, summary, insights, prompts) in the workspace and TodayMission
  covers the decision on Home; a third surface would duplicate (see DO_NOT_BUILD §7).
- [ ] Feedback aggregation → prompt decisions (AI6 fix).

## Phase 4 — Adaptive learning (started: batch mastery writes)

- [x] Batch mastery writes (P-F2): bulk-read + per-row upsert via shared pure transition
  (`recordQuestionAttempts`), all three submit paths migrated with identical semantics.
- [x] Dead code removed: `SessionSummary.tsx`, `NextBestAction.tsx` (+ orphan test).

## Phase 5 — Advanced intelligence

- Acceptance-weighted re-ranker (O10) — bandit over rec ids.
- Forgetting curves per topic; interleaved drills; confidence calibration.
- Dynamic study plan from readiness gaps.

## Phase 5 — Advanced intelligence

- Predictive readiness trajectories; pattern detection (time-of-day, fatigue);
  adaptive exam simulation; long-term learner modeling. Only with Phase-2 data density.
